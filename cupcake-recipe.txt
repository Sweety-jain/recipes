How to Make Eggless Coffee Cupcakes
Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees C. Line the cupcake moulds with paper cupcake liners.In a bowl sift maida, baking powder, cocoa powder and sugar.Add in softened butter, vanilla essence, coffee paste and milk till a smooth batter forms.Pour the batter into the moulds and bake at 180 degrees until done. (Approximately 15-20 minutes)You check if they're done by inserting a toothpick into the cupcake. If the toothpick comes out clean, it means it's done.Take the cupcakes out of the oven. Let them cool entirely. Note: Do not frost them unless they are completely cool as the frosting will start to melt.

You can frost the cupcakes with mascarpone cheese with a shot of whiskey or some coffee butter cream. Here, coffee cream cheese frosting has been used.
